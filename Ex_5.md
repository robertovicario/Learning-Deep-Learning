### Transformer

1. **Explanation of "Attention is All You Need":**
   - The paper titled "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. introduces the Transformer model, which relies entirely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrent and convolutional neural networks traditionally used in sequence modeling tasks. The key innovation is the use of self-attention to allow the model to weigh the importance of different words in an input sequence regardless of their position.

2. **True/False Statements on Transformer Architectures:**
   - **They allow for a better parallelisation of the processing.** True. Transformers can process all tokens in a sequence simultaneously, unlike RNNs, which process tokens sequentially.
   - **They allow to handle larger training sets.** True. Due to their ability to leverage parallel processing and efficient training mechanisms, Transformers can scale up to handle larger datasets.
   - **They include an encoder and decoder parts as in seq2seq.** True. The Transformer architecture consists of an encoder-decoder structure, similar to traditional seq2seq models.
   - **Building blocks of the decoder part include 2 layers.** False. Each block in the decoder part of the Transformer includes multiple sub-layers (e.g., self-attention, encoder-decoder attention, and feedforward layers).
   - **The input of the decoder block is word embedding (for NLP applications).** True. The input to the decoder block typically consists of word embeddings combined with positional encodings.

3. **Self in Self-Attention:**
   - **Explanation:** The term "self" in self-attention refers to the mechanism's ability to compute attention scores for a token with respect to all tokens in the same sequence, including itself. This allows each token to gather contextual information from the entire sequence, enhancing its representation based on the relationships between tokens.

### Auto-Encoders

1. **Designing a Denoising Auto-Encoder:**
   - **Steps to Train:**
     - **Data Preparation:** Collect a dataset of images and create noisy versions of these images.
     - **Model Architecture:** Design an encoder to compress the input image into a latent representation and a decoder to reconstruct the image from this representation.
     - **Training:** Train the auto-encoder using a loss function such as mean squared error (MSE) between the original and reconstructed images.
     - **Evaluation:** Validate the performance using a separate set of noisy images to ensure the model can generalize.

2. **Typical Applications of Auto-Encoders:**
   - **Applications:**
     - **Denoising:** Removing noise from images or signals.
     - **Dimensionality Reduction:** Compressing data while preserving important features.
     - **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual patterns in data by comparing reconstruction errors.
     - **Generative Modeling:** Learning data distributions for generating new data samples.
   - **Why and How:**
     - Auto-encoders learn to capture the essential features of the input data, making them useful for tasks requiring data compression or feature extraction.

3. **Advantages and Disadvantages of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE):**
   - **Advantages:**
     - **Generative Capability:** VAEs can generate new data samples by sampling from the learned latent space.
     - **Regularization:** VAEs introduce a probabilistic framework that regularizes the latent space, leading to better generalization.
   - **Disadvantages:**
     - **Complex Training:** Training VAEs involves optimizing a more complex loss function that includes both reconstruction and KL divergence terms.
     - **Less Sharp Outputs:** Generated samples may be less sharp compared to those from other generative models like GANs.

4. **Additional Ingredient in VAEs:**
   - **Key Ingredient:** The key additional ingredient in VAEs is the **KL divergence term** in the loss function, which regularizes the latent space to follow a prior distribution (usually a Gaussian). This term encourages the encoder to produce latent representations that are well-distributed and smooth, facilitating generative tasks.

### Generative Models (1)

1. **Using VAE as a Generator:**
   - **Explanation:** A variational autoencoder can be used as a generator because it learns a latent space that represents the underlying data distribution. By sampling from this latent space and passing the samples through the decoder, new data instances can be generated that resemble the training data.

2. **Sampling New Images with VAE:**
   - **Explanation:**
     - **Step 1:** Sample a point from the latent space, typically from a Gaussian distribution.
     - **Step 2:** Pass this point through the decoder network to generate a new image.
     - This process leverages the regularized latent space learned during training, ensuring the generated samples are coherent.

3. **Using VAE as a Feature Extractor:**
   - **Explanation:** The encoder part of a VAE compresses input data into a lower-dimensional latent representation. These representations capture the essential features of the input data and can be used as inputs for downstream tasks like classification or clustering.

### Generative Models (2)

1. **Training Principles of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**
   - **Explanation:**
     - **Two Networks:** GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator.
     - **Adversarial Training:** The generator creates fake data samples, and the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake samples. The generator aims to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator aims to correctly identify real vs. fake samples.
     - **Loss Functions:** The generator is trained to minimize the probability of the discriminator identifying fake samples, and the discriminator is trained to maximize the probability of correctly identifying real samples.

2. **Generative and Adversarial in GANs:**
   - **Generative:** The generator network creates new data samples from random noise.
   - **Adversarial:** The training process involves a competition (adversarial game) between the generator and discriminator, driving both networks to improve their performance.

3. **Training Challenges of GANs vs. VAEs:**
   - **Training GANs is more difficult because:**
     - **Mode Collapse:** The generator may produce limited variations of samples, leading to poor diversity.
     - **Training Instability:** The adversarial nature can cause unstable training dynamics, making it hard to converge.
     - **Sensitive to Hyperparameters:** GANs require careful tuning of hyperparameters to achieve good performance.

4. **Basic Idea Behind Diffusion Models:**
   - **Explanation:** Diffusion models generate data by iteratively denoising samples. They start with noise and gradually refine it into a coherent data sample. This process involves learning the reverse of a diffusion process, where noise is added to data in multiple steps. Training involves learning how to reverse this noise addition effectively.
